- Multi-Session/Account Support
- Multi-Device Support
- WhatsApp Authentication (QR Code and Logout)
- WhatsApp Messaging Send Text
- WhatsApp Messaging Send Media (Document, Image, Audio, Video, Sticker)
- WhatsApp Messaging Send Location
- WhatsApp Messaging Send Contact

- And Much More ...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Prequisites packages:
* Go (Go Programming Language)
* Swag (Go Annotations Converter to Swagger Documentation)
* GoReleaser (Go Automated Binaries Build)
* Make (Automated Execution using Makefile)

Optional packages:
* Docker (Application Containerization)

### Deployment

#### **Using Container**

1) Install Docker CE based on the [manual documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

2) Run the following command on your Terminal or PowerShell
```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --name go-whatsapp-multidevice \
  --rm dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest:latest
```

3) Now it should be accessible in your machine by accessing `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp`

4) Try to use integrated API docs that accesible in `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/`

#### **Using Pre-Build Binaries**

1) Download Pre-Build Binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest/releases)

2) Extract the zipped file

3) Copy the `.env.default` file as `.env` file

4) Run the pre-build binary
```sh
# MacOS / Linux
chmod 755 go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest
./go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest

# Windows
# You can double click it or using PowerShell
.\go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest.exe
```

5) Now it should be accessible in your machine by accessing `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp`

6) Try to use integrated API docs that accesible in `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/`

#### **Build From Source**

Below is the instructions to make this source code running:

1) Create a Go Workspace directory and export it as the extended GOPATH directory
```sh
cd <your_go_workspace_directory>
export GOPATH=$GOPATH:"`pwd`"
```

2) Under the Go Workspace directory create a source directory
```sh
mkdir -p src/github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest
```

3) Move to the created directory and pull codebase
```sh
cd src/github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest
git clone -b master https://github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest.git .
```

4) Run following command to pull vendor packages
```sh
make vendor
```

5) Link or copy environment variables file
```sh
ln -sf .env.example .env
# - OR -
cp .env.example .env
```

6) Until this step you already can run this code by using this command
```sh
make run
```

7) *(Optional)* Use following command to build this code into binary spesific platform
```sh
make build
```

8) *(Optional)* To make mass binaries distribution you can use following command
```sh
make release
```

9) Now it should be accessible in your machine by accessing `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp`

10) Try to use integrated API docs that accesible in `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/`

## API Access

You can access any endpoint under **HTTP_BASE_URL** environment variable which by default located at `.env` file.

Integrated API Documentation can be accessed in `<HTTP_BASE_URL>/docs/` or by default it's in `localhost:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/` or `127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/whatsapp/docs/`

## Running The Tests

Currently the test is not ready yet :)
